<br>

To normalize the easy difficulty and be faithful to

the historical accuracy. Nerfed the early MS and

increased the mid-game, specially the Jegan MS.

<br>

Although the early operation is difficult compared

To other factions, but the Gap will be filled with better

perf of the Earth Federation Army's long-range Units.

<br>

##### There're also low-level code modifications

- All MSs become Thanosed anti-ship attack power

- v03 : ( Attack + 2 ) ÷ 2

- V05 : ( Attack + 1 ) ÷ 2 + 1

<br>

##### Modding only for v05 !

- When press the Tec Up, the other factions also upgraded

 at a Certain rate. (Reflecting real case of Tech theft)

- Like 2/7 ratio, To resolve the maximum Initial TecLev of 20.

- Reflecting the tension of the TecUp together of old G or GX

- Rarely, the User's tech also increase double, like 1/7 ratio

- Beta ver Caution ! : If press Tec Up when enough money,

  Tec Up will cause a critical error !!

- Other common issue : Ugly tile patterns output on the main

  background screen, because some codes are allocated to the

  graphic area ( v05 look like Jiong? )

 <br>

#### This Patch includes translations of the old English Ver.

 <br>


### Future update plan
