To other factions, but the Gap will be filled with better

perf of the Earth Federation Army's long-range Units.

<br>

##### Modding only for v05 !

- When press the Tec Up, the other factions also upgraded

 At a certain rate. (Reflecting real case of tech theft)

- Like 2/7 ratio, To resolve the maximum Initial TecLev of 20.

- Reflecting the tension of the TecUp together of old G or GX

- Rarely, the User's tech also increase double, like 1/7 ratio

- Beta ver Caution ! : If press Tec Up when enough money,

  Tec Up will cause a critical error !!
